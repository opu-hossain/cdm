Branch: `cdm` (user-requested in place of `phase-0-foundations`)
Commit: `fix(thread): align dm_mutex_destroy signature across platforms` (this entry's commit)

Tasks completed:
- 0.1.1 Align the Windows `dm_mutex_destroy` definition with the `void` declaration and POSIX implementation.

Tests:
- Baseline: `cmake --build build -j` and CTest 24/24 passed.
- After change: `cmake --build build -j` and CTest 24/24 passed.
- Smoke: `./build/tests/test_thread --filter thread/mutex_reinitialize_after_destroy --verbose` passed (1/1).
- Windows cross-compiler was unavailable, so the Windows translation unit was not compiled locally. The test-first case passed on Linux; the pre-fix Windows definition conflicts with the header at compile time.
- Criterion requires local IPC sockets; sandboxed runs failed at socket bind and the successful runs used the permitted test environment.

Open questions:
- None for task 0.1.1.

Next:
- 0.1.2 Fix CLI `--header` dangling pointer.
